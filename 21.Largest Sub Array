Largest Sub Array
Given an array containing only 0’s and 1’s, Find the largest subarray containing an equal number of 0s and 1s.
Input specification:
Input 1: The length of an array.
Input 2: Array containing 0s and 1s.
Output Specification:
Return the length of the largest sub-array containing equal no. of 0s and 1s.
Example 1:
Input 1: 4
Input 2: {1,1,0,1}
Output: 2
Explanation:
The largest possible array here would be of length 2 as there should be an equal number of 0 and 1 in it. The starting index and ending index of the largest subarray is 1 and 2. Hence the output is 2.
Example 2:
Input 1: 5
Input 2: {1,1,1,1,1}
Output: 0
Explanation:
In the above example, there are no 0s in the array. Hence the output is 0.

n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split(",")))
p=l.count(0)
s=l.count(1)
print(p)
print(s)
print(abs(p-s))

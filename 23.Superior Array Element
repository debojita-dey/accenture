Superior Array Element
In an array, a superior element is one that is greater than all elements to its right. the rightmost element will always be considered as a superior element.
Here, the function accepts an integer array ‘arr’ and its length ‘n’. Implement the function to find and return the number of superior element in the array ‘arr’.
Assumptions:
1. n>0
2. Array index starts from 0.
Example 1:
Input 1: 7 9 5 2 8 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
9 is greater than all the elements to its right, 8 is greater than the element to its right, and 7 is the rightmost element. hence total 3 superior elements.
Sample Input:
2 8 9 7 4 2
Sample Output:
4

Sum of Uncommon Elements
The function accepts two integer arrays ‘arr’ and ‘arr2’ of sizes n and m respectively as its argument. Implement the function to find and return the sum of all uncommon elements in two arrays (elements which are present in only one of the array).
Note:
Return -1 if both arrays are null (None in the case of Python).
If one of the arrays is null then return the sum of all elements of the other array.
Example 1:
Input 1: 9 -4 3 2 -5
Input 2: 2 -5 7 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
Uncommon elements of two arrays are -4,3 and 7. Sum of uncommon elements = -4 + 3 + 7 = 6. Thus, output is 6.



l=list(map(int,input().split(" ")))
p=list(map(int,input().split(" ")))
s1=set(l)
s2=set(p)
d=s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
f=print(sum(d))

Array Permutation
The function accepts an integer array ‘arr’ of length ‘size’ as the argument. Implement the function to find and return the maximum number that can be formed by any permutation or arrangement of the digits obtained from all the numbers present in the array. You have to return the number formed as a string.
Note: You may need to rearrange the digits of the numbers to form the maximum number.
Example:
Input: 34 79 58 64
Output: 98765443
Explanation:
All digits from all the numbers of the array are 3,4,7,9,5,8,6,4. Maximum number obtained after rearranging all these digit gives 98765443.
Sample input:
21 90 23
Sample Output:
932210



a=input()
b=a.replace(" ","")
l1=[]
for i in b:
    l1.append(i)
l1.sort(reverse=True)
print("".join(l1))

# choto to boro sort

a=input()
b=a.replace(" ","")
l1=[]
for i in b:
    l1.append(i)
l1.sort()
print("".join(l1))

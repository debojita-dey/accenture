Given a string, find the frequencies of each of the characters in it.
The input string contains only lowercase letters. The output string should contain a letter followed by its frequency, in the alphabetical order (from a to z).
Input specification:
Input 1: The input string.
Output Specification:
Return a string representing the frequency counts of characters in the input string.
Example 1:
Input 1: babdc
Output: a1b2c1d1
Explanation:
In the input string, ‘a’ appears once, ‘b’ appears twice, ‘c’ and ‘d’ appear once.


x1=input()
x=x1
x=set(x)
x=list(x)
x.sort()
for i in x:
    print(i,end="")
    print(x1.count(i),end="")
